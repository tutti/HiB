Sequences a[n]d series
(1, 2, 3, 4, 5) != (5, 4, 3, 2, 1)
Not sets - order matters, values ca[n] appear more tha[n] once

Sequence definition:
A sequence is a collection of numbers in a given order.

Infinite sequence: (1, -1, 1, -1, ...)

An unspecified sequence we refer to as
a = (a0, a1, a2, ..., a[n])

Example:
a[n] = (2n-1) / 4
a0 = -1/4
a1 = 1/4
a2 = 3/4
a3 = 5/4

Example:
a = (-1, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 11, ...)
a[n] = 2n-1

Limit of a sequence:
Definition:
Let a = (a0, a1, a2, ...).
A number L is called the limit of the series a if the numbers a[n] are arbitrarily close to L for all sufficiently large n.
More formally:
For any positive number ε, we demand that there exists an integer N such that |a[n]-L|<ε for all n > N.
In this case, we say that the sequence converges to L.
In short:
lim a[n] = L
n->inf

If there is no such L, we say that the sequence diverges. In the special case that the sequence diverges but grows unboundedly, we say it
diverges to infinity. In other words, we demand that for any R there exists a number N such that a[n] > R for all n > N. Similarly for -infinity.

Example:
a[n] = (-2)^n
Diverges, but not to infinity or -infinity.

Example:
lim (n->inf) 1/(n^2) = 0

Example:
lim (n->inf) (3n^2 - 4n + 3) / (7n^2 + 5n + 10) = 3/7
The smaller factors are losing their significance

Arithmetic sequence
Definition:
An arithmetic sequence is a sequence with numbers of the form:
    a[n] = s+n*t,
where s and t are real numbers.
This can also be written as:
    (s, s+t, s+2t, s+3t, ...)
Example:
    (1, 2, 3, 4, 5, ...) : s=1, t=1
Arithmetic sequences converge only if t=0

Geometric sequence
Definition:
A geometric sequence has the form:
    a[n] = r*k^n,
where r and k are real numbers.
This can also be written as:
    (r, r*k, r*k^2, r*k^3, ...)
Example:
    (1, 2, 4, 8, 16) : r=1 , k=2
Example:
    (1, -1, 1, -1, ...) : r=1, k=-1
Example:
    (2, 2/3, 2/9, 2/27) : r=2, k=1/3

Theorem: A geometric sequence a[n] = r*k^n (r!=0) converges iff -1 < k <= 1.
    - If -1 < k < 1 it converges towards 0
    - If k = 1 it is constant and hence converges to r
    - If k > 1 then it diverges towards infinity or -infinity (depending on r)
    - If k <= -1 then it diverges neither to infinity nor -infinity

Series
Definition:
The sigma-notation for the sum of a finite sequence a = (a0, a1, ..., a[n]) is
    n
    Σ   ai = a0 + a1 + ... + a[n]
    i=0

For infinite series, we take the limit, if it exists, of the finite partial sums:
    inf                   n
    Σ   ai = lim (n->inf) Σ   ai
    i=0                   i=0

If the limit exists, we say the series converges, otherwise it diverges.

Example:
    3
    Σ   2i+1 = 1+3+5+7 = 16
    i=0

Example:
    inf
    Σ   1/i^2 = π^2/6
    i=1

Example:
    1 - 1/2 + 1/3 - 1/4 ...
    inf
    Σ   (-1^i) / i+1 = ln 2
    i=0
